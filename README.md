# Crystal Collectors Game

* **Created:** Sunday, March 4th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the fourth week's 1st homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are constructing a Crystal Collectors Game using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this assignment, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
